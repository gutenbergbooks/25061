<h1>THE<br />
PENAL<br />
CLUSTER</h1>

<h2><small>By IVAR JORGENSEN</small></h2>

<p class="tease"><i>Tomorrow's technocracy will
produce more and more things
for better living. It will
produce other things, also;
among them, criminals too
despicable to live on this
earth. Too abominable to
breathe our free air.</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> clipped British voice
said, in David Houston's
ear, <i>I'm quite sure he's one.
He's cashing a check for a
thousand pounds. Keep him
under surveillance.</i></p>

<p>Houston didn't look up immediately.
He simply stood
there in the lobby of the big
London bank, filling out a deposit
slip at one of the long,
high desks. When he had finished,
he picked up the slip
and headed towards the
teller's cage.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, standing at
the window, was a tall, impeccably
dressed, aristocratic-looking
man with graying
hair.</p>

<p>"The man in the tweeds?"
Houston whispered. His voice
was so low that it was inaudible
a foot away, and his lips
scarcely moved. But the sensitive
microphone in his collar
picked up the voice and
relayed it to the man behind
the teller's wicket.</p>

<p><i>That's him</i>, said the tiny
speaker hidden in Houston's
ear. <i>The fine-looking chap in
the tweeds and bowler.</i></p>

<p>"Got him," whispered
Houston.</p>

<hr />

<p>He didn't go anywhere
near the man in the bowler
and tweeds; instead, he went
to a window several feet
away.</p>

<p>"Deposit," he said, handing
the slip to the man on the
other side of the partition.
While the teller went through
the motions of putting the
deposit through the robot accounting
machine, David
Houston kept his ears open.</p>

<p>"How did you want the
thousand, sir?" asked the
teller in the next wicket.</p>

<p>"Ten pound notes, if you
please," said the graying man.
"I think a hundred notes will
go into my brief case easily
enough." He chuckled, as
though he'd made a clever witticism.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the clerk,
smiling.</p>

<p>Houston whispered into his
microphone again. "Who is
the guy?"</p>

<p>On the other side of the
partition, George Meredith, a
small, unimposing-looking
man, sat at a desk marked:
MR. MEREDITH&mdash;ACCOUNTING
DEPT. He looked
as though he were paying
no attention whatever to anything
going on at the various
windows, but he, too, had a
microphone at his throat and
a hidden pickup in his ear.</p>

<p>At Houston's question, he
whispered: "That's Sir Lewis
Huntley. The check's good, of
course. Poor fellow."</p>

<p>"Yeah," whispered Houston,
"if he is what we think
he is."</p>

<p>"I'm fairly certain," Meredith
replied. "Sir Lewis isn't
the type of fellow to draw
that much in cash. At the
present rate of exchange,
that's worth three thousand
seven hundred and fifty dollars
American. Sir Lewis
might carry a hundred
pounds as pocket-money, but
never a thousand."</p>

<p>Houston and Meredith were
a good thirty feet from each
other, and neither looked at
the other. Unless a bystander
had equipment to tune in on
the special scrambled wavelength
they were using, that
bystander would never know
they were holding a conversation.</p>

<p>"... nine-fifty, nine-sixty,
nine-seventy, nine-eighty,
nine-ninety, a thousand
pounds," said the clerk who
was taking care of Sir Lewis's
check. "Would you count that
to make sure, sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Ten, twenty,
thirty, ..."</p>

<p>While the baronet was
double-checking the amount,
David Houston glanced at
him. Sir Lewis looked perfectly
calm and unhurried, as
though he were doing something
perfectly legal&mdash;which,
in a way, he was. And, in another
way, he most definitely
was not, if George Meredith's
suspicions were correct.</p>

<p>"Your receipt, sir." It was
the teller at Houston's own
window.</p>

<p>Houston took the receipt,
thanked the teller, and walked
toward the broad front
doors of the bank.</p>

<p>"George," he whispered
into the throat mike, "has
Sir Lewis noticed me?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't so much as looked
at you," Meredith answered.
"Good hunting."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<hr />

<p>As Houston stepped outside
the bank, he casually dropped
one hand into a coat pocket
and turned a small knob on
his radio control box. "Houston
to HQ," he whispered.</p>

<p>"London HQ; what is it,
Houston?" asked the earpiece.</p>

<p>"Leadenhall Street Post.
Meredith thinks he's spotted
one. Sir Lewis Huntley."</p>

<p>"Righto. We've got men in
that part of the city now.
We'll have a network posted
within five minutes. Can you
hold onto him that long?"</p>

<p>Houston looked around.
Leadenhall Street was full of
people, and the visibility was
low. "I'll have to tail him
pretty closely," Houston said.
"Your damned English fogs
don't give a man much chance
to see anything."</p>

<p>There was a chuckle from
the earphone. "Cheer up,
Yank; you should have seen it
back before 1968. When
atomic power replaced coal
and oil, our fogs became a
devil of a lot cleaner."</p>

<p>The voice was quite clear;
at the London headquarters
of the UN Psychodeviant Police,
there was no need to wear
a throat mike, which had a
tendency to make the voice
sound muffled in spite of the
Statistical Information-Bit
Samplers which were supposed
to clarify the speech
coming through them.</p>

<p>"What do you know about
1968?" Houston asked sardonically.
"Your mother was still
pushing you around in a
baby-carriage then."</p>

<p>"In a pram," corrected the
Headquarters operator. "That
is true, but my dear Aunt Jennifer
told me all about it. She
was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hell with your Aunt
Jennifer," Houston interrupted
suddenly. "Here comes Sir
Lewis. Get me cover&mdash;fast!"</p>

<p>"Right. Keep us posted."</p>

<p>Sir Lewis Huntley stepped
out of the broad door of the
bank and turned left. He took
a couple of steps and stopped.
He didn't look around; he
simply took a cigarette out of
a silver case, put it in his
mouth, and lit it. The glow of
the lighter shone yellowly on
the brass plate near the door
which said: <i>An Affiliate of
Westminster Bank, Ltd.</i></p>

<p>Sir Lewis snapped the light
out, drew on the cigarette,
and strode on down the street,
swinging a blue plastex brief
case which contained a thousand
pounds in United Nations
Bank of England notes.</p>

<p>Houston decided the baronet
had not been looking for
a tail; he wished he could
probe the man's mind to make
sure, but he knew that would
be fatal. He'd have to play the
game and hope for the best.</p>

<p>"He's heading east," Houston
whispered. "Doesn't look
as if he's going to get a cab."</p>

<p>"Check," said the earphone.</p>

<p>Sir Lewis seemed in no
great hurry, but he walked
briskly, as though he had a
definite destination in mind.</p>

<p>After a little way, he crossed
to the south side of
Leadenhall Street and kept
going east. Houston stayed far
enough behind to be above
suspicion, but not so far that
he ran a chance of losing his
man.</p>

<p>"He's turning south on
Fenchurch," Houston said a
little later. "I wonder where
he's going."</p>

<p>"Keep after him," said
Headquarters. "Our net men
haven't spotted either of you
yet. They can hardly see
across the street in this
damned fog."</p>

<p>Houston kept going.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" he whispered
a few minutes later.
"He's still following Fenchurch
Street! He's doubling
back!"</p>

<p>Leadenhall Street, the
banking center of the City of
London, runs almost due east-and-west;
Fenchurch Street
makes a forty-five degree
angle with it at the western
end, running southwest for a
bit and then curving toward
the west, toward Lombard.</p>

<p>"Houston," said HQ, "touch
your left ear."</p>

<p>Houston obediently reached
up and scratched his left ear.</p>

<p>"Okay," said HQ. "Bogart's
spotted you, but he hasn't
spotted Sir Lewis. Bogart's
across the street."</p>

<p>"He can't miss Sir Lewis,"
whispered Houston. "Conservatively
dressed&mdash;matching
coat and trousers of orange
nylon tweed&mdash;royal blue half-brim
bowler&mdash;carrying a blue
brief case."</p>

<p>There was a pause, then:
"Yeah. Bogart's spotted him,
and so has MacGruder. Mac's
on your side, a few yards
ahead."</p>

<p>"Check. How about the rest
of the net?"</p>

<p>"Coming, coming. Be patient,
old man."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> patient," growled
Houston. <i>I have to be</i>, he
thought to himself, <i>otherwise
I'd never stay alive</i>.</p>

<p>"We've got him bracketed
now," HQ said. "If we lose
him now, he's a magician."</p>

<p>Sir Lewis walked on, seemingly
oblivious to the group
of men who had surrounded
him. He came to the end of
Fenchurch Street and looked
to his left, towards London
Bridge. Then he glanced to his
right.</p>

<p>"I think he's looking for a
cab," Houston whispered.</p>

<p>"That's what MacGruder
says," came the reply. "We've
got Arthmore in a cab behind
you; he'll pick you up. MacGruder
will get another cab,
and we have a private car for
Bogart."</p>

<p>Sir Lewis flagged a cab,
climbed in, and gave an address
to the driver. Houston
didn't hear it, but MacGruder,
a heavy-set, short, balding
man, was standing near
enough to get the instructions
Sir Lewis had given to the
driver.</p>

<hr />

<p>A cab pulled up to the curb
near Houston, and he got in.</p>

<p>Arthmore, the driver, was a
thin, tall, hawknosed individual
who could have played
Sherlock Holmes on TV. Once
he got into character for a
part, he never got out of it
unless absolutely necessary.
Right now, he was a Cockney
cab-driver, and he would play
the part to the hilt.</p>

<p>"Where to, guv'nor?" he
asked innocently.</p>

<p>"Buckingham Palace," said
Houston. "I've got a poker
appointment with Prince
Charles."</p>

<p>"Blimey, guv'nor," said
Arthmore. "You <i>are</i> movin' in
'igh circles! 'Ow's 'Er Majesty
these days?"</p>

<p>The turboelectric motor
hummed, and the cab shot off
into traffic. "According to the
report I get on the blinkin'
wireless," he continued, "a
chap named MacGruder
claims that the eminent Sir
Lewis 'Untley is 'eaded for
Number 37 Upper Berkeley
Mews."</p>

<p>"One of these days," said
Houston, "all those <i>H</i>'s you
drop is going to bounce back
and hit you in the face."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Mr. Yewston?"
Arthmore asked blankly.</p>

<p>Houston grinned. "Nothing,
cabbie; it's just that you remind
me of a cultured, intelligent
fellow named Jack
Arthmore. The only difference
is that Jack speaks the
Queen's English."</p>

<p>"Crikey!" said Arthmore.
"Wot a coincidence!" He
paused, then: "The Queen's
English, you say? She <i>'as</i> to
be, don't she?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Houston
conversationally. "And give
me a cigarette," he added.</p>

<p>"There's a package of
Players in my shirt pocket,"
Arthmore said, keeping his
hands on the wheel.</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston fished out a cigarette,
lit it, and returned the
pack.</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, Arthmore
said: "Reminds me of
the time I was workin' for a
printer, see? We 'ad to print
up a bunch of 'andbills advertisin'
a church charity bazaar.
Down at the bottom was supposed
to be printed 'Under the
auspices of St. Bede's-on-Thames.'
So I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went on with a long,
rambling tale about making a
mistake in printing the handbill.
Houston paid little attention.
He smoked in silence,
keeping his eyes on the red
glow of the taillight ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Neither man mentioned the
approaching climax of the
chase. Even hardened veterans
of the Psychodeviant Police
don't look forward to the
possibility of having their
minds taken over, controlled
by some outside force.</p>

<p>It had never happened to
Houston, but he knew that
Arthmore had been through
the experience once. It evidently
wasn't pleasant.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and the boss was 'oppin'
mad," Arthmore was saying,
"but, crikey, 'ow was I to
know that <i>auspice</i> was spelled
A-U-S-P-I-C-E?"</p>

<p>Houston grinned. "Yeah,
sure. How're we doing with
Sir Lewis?"</p>

<p>"Seems to be headed in the
right direction," Arthmore
said, suddenly dropping the
Cockney accent. "This is the
route I'd take if I were headed
for Upper Berkeley Mews.
He probably hasn't told the
driver to change addresses&mdash;maybe
he won't."</p>

<p>"The victims never do,"
Houston said. "He probably is
actually headed toward Number
37 Upper Berkeley
Mews."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Nobody's perfect,"
said Arthmore.</p>

<hr />

<p>Forty-five minutes of steady
progress through the streets
of Greater London brought
Sir Lewis Huntley to Upper
Berkeley and to the short
dead-end street which constituted
the Mews. By the time
the dapper baronet stepped
out of the machine and paid
his driver, the whole area was
surrounded by and filled with
the well-armed, silent, and
careful agents of the Psychodeviant
Police.</p>

<p>Number 37 was an old concrete-and-steel
structure of
the George VI period, faced
with a veneer of red brick. It
had obviously been remodeled
at least once to make the
fa&ccedil;ade more modern and more
fashionable; the red-violet
anodized aluminum was relatively
fresh and unstained. It
wouldn't have taken vast
wealth to rent a flat in the
building, but neither would an
average income have been
quite enough.</p>

<p>Houston looked out of the
window of Arthmore's cab
and glanced at the tiers of
windows in the building. Presumably,
the man they were
looking for was up there&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p><i>So you occupy a station
in the upper middle-class</i>,
thought Houston. It checked.
Every bit of evidence that
came his way seemed to check
perfectly and fit neatly into
the hypothesis which he had
formed. Soon it would be
time to test that theory&mdash;but
the time had not yet come.</p>

<p>"Stand by and wait for orders,
Houston," said the
speaker in Houston's ear.
"We've got men inside the
building."</p>

<p>Sir Lewis Huntley opened
the sparkling, translucent
door of Number 37 Upper
Berkeley Mews and went inside.</p>

<p>Arthmore pulled the cab
over to the curb a few yards
from the entrance and the two
men waited in silence. All
around them were other men,
some in private cars, some
walking slowly along the
street. All of them were part
of the net that had gathered
to catch one man.</p>

<p><i>Poor fish</i>, Houston thought
wryly.</p>

<p>There was no noise, no excitement.
Five minutes after
Sir Lewis had entered the
front door, it opened again. A
man whom Houston had never
seen before stepped out and
gestured with one hand. At
the same time, Houston's
speaker said: "They've got
him. Hit him with a stun gun
when he tried to get out
through the fire exit."</p>

<p>An ambulance which had
been waiting at the entrance
of the Mews pulled up in
front of Number 37, and a
minute or so later a little clot
of men came out bearing a
stretcher, which was loaded
into the ambulance. Immediately
after them came another
man who had a firm, but
polite grip on the arm of Sir
Lewis Huntley.</p>

<p>Houston sighed and leaned
back in his seat. That was
that. It was all over. Simple.
Nothing to it.</p>

<p>Another Controller had
been apprehended by the Psychodeviant
Police. Another
deviant, already tried and
found guilty, was ready to be
exiled from Earth and imprisoned
on one of the Penal Asteroids.
All in the day's work.</p>

<p><i>There's just one thing I'd
like to know</i>, Houston thought
blackly. <i>What in the hell's going
on?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>In his hotel room near Piccadilly
Circus, several hours
later, David Houston sat
alone, drink in hand, and put
that same question to himself
again.</p>

<p>"What's going on?"</p>

<p>On the face of it, it was
simple. On the face of it, the
answer was right in front of
him, printed in black and
white on the front page of the
evening <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Houston lifted the paper off
the bed and looked at it. The
banner line said: <i>Controller
Captured in Lambeth!</i></p>

<p>Beneath that, in smaller
type, the headline added:
Robert Harris Accused of
Taking Control of Barrister
Sir Lewis Huntley.</p>

<p>The column itself told the
whole story. Mr. Robert Harris,
of No. 37 Upper Berkeley
Mews, had, by means of mental
control, taken over the
mind of Sir Lewis and compelled
him to draw one thousand
pounds out of his bank.
While Sir Lewis was returning
to Harris with the money,
the United Nations Psychodeviant
Police had laid a trap.
Sir Lewis, upon recovering
his senses when Harris was
rendered unconscious by a
stun gun, had given evidence
to the PD Police and to officials
at New Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Houston looked at the full-color
photo of Harris that
was printed alongside the column.
Nice-looking chap; late
twenties or early thirties,
Houston guessed. Blond-red
hair, blue eyes. All-in-all, a
very pleasant, but ordinary
sort of man.</p>

<p>There had been evidence
that a Controller had been at
work in London for some
weeks now. Twelve days before,
several men, following
an impulse, had mailed twenty
pounds to a "Richard
Hempstead," General Delivery,
Waterloo Station. By the
time the matter had come to
the authorities' attention, the
envelopes had been called for
and the Controller had
escaped.</p>

<p>Robert Harris was not the
first Controller to be captured,
nor, Houston knew,
would he be the last. The first
one had shown up more than
sixteen years before, in Dallas,
Texas, USA.</p>

<p>Houston grinned as he
thought of it. Projective
telepathy had only been a
crackpot's idea back then. In
spite of the work of many intelligent,
sane men, who had
shown that mental powers
above and beyond the ordinary
did exist, the average man
simply laughed off such nonsense.
It was mysticism; it
was magic; it was foolish superstition.
It was anything
but true.</p>

<p>But ever since "Blackjack"
Donnely had practically taken
control of the whole city of
Dallas, the average man had
changed his mind. It was still
mysterious; it was still magic;
but now the weird machinations
of the supernormal
mind were something to be
feared.</p>

<p>In the sixteen years that
had ensued since the discovery
of the abnormal mental
powers of "Blackjack" Donnely,
rumors had spread all
over the world. There were
supposed to be men who could
levitate&mdash;fly through the air
at will. Others could walk
through walls, and still others
could make themselves invisible.
The horrible monsters
that were supposed to be
walking the Earth were
legion.</p>

<hr />

<p>Actually, only one type
of supernormal psychodeviant
had been found&mdash;the telepath,
the mindreader who could
probe into the mental processes
of others. Worse than
that, the telepath could project
his own thoughts into the
mind of another, so that the
victim supposed that the
thoughts were his own. Actually,
it was a high-powered
form of hypnotism; the victim
could be made to do anything
the projective telepath wanted
him to.</p>

<p>"Blackjack" Donnely had
made that clear in his trial in
Texas.</p>

<p>Donnely had been a big man&mdash;big
physically, and important
in city politics. He had
also been as arrogant as the
Devil himself.</p>

<p>It was the arrogance that
had finally tripped up Donnely.
He had thought himself
impregnable. Haled into court
on charges of misappropriation
of public funds, he had
just sat and smirked while
several witnesses for the State
admitted that they had aided
Donnely, but they claimed he
had "hypnotized" them. Donnely
didn't try to interfere
with the evidence&mdash;that's
where he made his mistake.
And that's where his arrogance
tripped him up.</p>

<hr />

<p>If he'd used telepathic
projection to influence the
State Attorney or the witnesses
or the judge or the
Grand Jury <i>before</i> the trial,
he might never have been discovered
as the first of the Controllers.
But that wasn't Donnely's
style.</p>

<p>"None of this namby-pamby
stuff," he had once been
quoted as saying; "if you got
enemies, don't tease 'em&mdash;show
'em who's running
things. Blackjack 'em, if you
have to."</p>

<p>And that's exactly what
"Blackjack" Donnely had
done. The trial was a farce
from beginning to end; each
witness gave his evidence
from the stand, and then Donnely
took control of their
minds and made them refute
every bit of it, publicly and
tearfully apologizing to the
"wonderful Mr. Donnely" for
saying such unkind things
about him.</p>

<p>The judge and the jury
knew something funny was
going on, but they had no evidence,
one way or another.
The case, even at that point,
might have ended with an acquittal
or a hung jury, but
Donnely wasn't through using
his blackjack.</p>

<p>He took over the mind of
the foreman of the jury. The
foreman claimed later that the
jury had decided that they
could reach no decision. Other
jurors claimed that they had
decided Donnely was guilty,
but that was probably an <i>ex
post facto</i> switch. It didn't
matter, anyway; when the
foreman came out, he pronounced
Donnely innocent.
That should have ended it.</p>

<p>The other jurors began to
protest, but by that time,
Donnely had gained control of
the judge's mind. Rapidly, the
judge silenced the jurors, declared
Donnely to be free, and
then publicly apologized for
ever daring to doubt Mr. Donnely.</p>

<p>The State's Attorney was
equally verbose in his apology;
he was almost in tears because
of his "deep contrition at having
cast aspersions on the
spotless character of so great
a man."</p>

<p>Donnely was released.</p>

<p>The next evening, "Blackjack"
Donnely was shot down
at the front door of his own
home. There were fifteen bullets
in his body; three from a
.32, five from a .38, and seven
from a .45.</p>

<p>The police investigation was
far from thorough; any evidence
that may have turned
up somehow got lost. It was
labelled as "homicide committed
by person or persons unknown,"
and it stayed that
way.</p>

<hr />

<p>Donnely was only the first.
In the next two years, four
more showed up. Everyone of
them, in one way or another,
had attempted to gain power
or money by mental projection.
Everyone of them was a
twisted megalomaniac.</p>

<p>Houston looked again at
Harris's picture on the front
page of the <i>Times</i>. Here was
one Controller who neither
looked nor acted like a megalomaniac.
That wouldn't make
much difference to the PD Police;
as far as the officials
were concerned, the ability to
project telepathically and the
taint of delusions of grandeur
went hand in hand. Controllers
were power-mad and
criminal by definition.</p>

<p>Fear still ruled the emotional
reactions against Controllers,
in spite of the
protection of the Psychodeviant
Police.</p>

<p>But David Houston knew
damned good and well that all
telepaths were not necessarily
insane.</p>

<p>He should know. He was a
Controller, himself.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Brrrring!</i></p>

<p>David Houston tossed the
paper on the bed and walked
over to the phone. He cut in
the circuit, and waited for the
phone's TV screen to show the
face of his caller. But the
screen remained blank.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" Houston asked.</p>

<p>"Is this CHAring Cross
7-8161?" It was a woman's
voice, soft and well-modulated.</p>

<p>"No, this is CHElsea
7-8161," Houston said. "You
must have dialed C-H-E instead
of C-H-A."</p>

<p>"Oh. I'm very sorry. Excuse
me." There was a click, and
she hung up.</p>

<p>Houston walked back over
to the bed and picked up his
paper. He looked at it, but he
didn't read it. It no longer interested
him.</p>

<p>So Dorrine was finally in
London, eh? He'd recognized
her voice instantly; even
years of training couldn't
smother the midwestern
American of Chicago completely
beneath the precise
British of the well-educated
English girl.</p>

<p>The signal had been agreed
upon, just in case his phone
was tapped. Even the Psychodeviant
Police could be suspected
of harboring a Controller&mdash;although
Houston
didn't think it too likely.
Nevertheless, he wasn't one to
take too many chances.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch. He
had an hour yet. He'd wait five
minutes before he phoned
headquarters.</p>

<hr />

<p>He sat down in his chair
again and forced himself to
relax, smoke a cigarette, and
read the paper&mdash;the sports
section. Perusing the records
of the season's cricket
matches kept his mind off that
picture on the front page. At
least, he hoped they would.
Let's see, now&mdash;Benton was
being rated as the finest googly
bowler on the Staffordshire
Club ...</p>

<p>Everything went fine until
he came across a reference to
a John Harris, a top-flight
batsman for Hambledon; that
reminded him of Robert Harris.
Houston threw down the
paper in disgust and walked
over to the phone.</p>

<p>The number was TROwbridge
5-4321, but no one ever
bothered to remember it.
Simply dial 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1,
and every time a voice at the
other end would answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hamilton speaking."</p>

<p>"Houston here; will I be
needed in the next hour or
so?"</p>

<p>"Mmmm. Just a second;
I'll check the roster. No; your
evidence won't be needed personally.
You've filed an affidavit.
No, I don't think&mdash;wait a
minute! Yes, there's a return
here for you; reservation on
the six A.M. jet to New York.
Your job here is done, Houston,
so you can take the rest
of the evening off and relax.
Going anywhere in particular?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd get a bite to
eat and take in a movie, maybe,
but if I'm due out at six,
I'll forego the cinematic diversion.
When's the trial?"</p>

<p>"It's scheduled for eleven-thirty
this evening. Going to
come?"</p>

<p>Houston shook his head.
"Not if I'm not needed to give
evidence. Those Controllers always
give me the creeps."</p>

<p>"They do everybody," said
Hamilton. "Well, you caught
him; there's no need for you
to stick around for the windup.
Have a good time."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Houston
shortly, and hung up.</p>

<p><i>The windup</i>, Houston
thought. <i>Sure. That's all it
will be. A Controller's trial is
a farce. Knock him out with a
stun gun and then pump him
full of comatol. How can he
defend himself if he's unconscious
all through the trial?</i></p>

<p>Houston knew what the
average man's answer to that
would be: "If a Controller
were allowed to remain conscious,
he'd take over the
judge's mind and get himself
freed."</p>

<p>Houston said an obscene
word under his breath, jammed
his hat on his head, put
on his coat, and left his apartment.</p>

<hr />

<p>With the coming of darkness,
the heavy fog had become
still denser. The yellow
beams of the sodium vapor
lamps were simply golden
spots hanging in an all-enveloping
blackness. Walking the
street was a process of moving
from one little golden island
of light to another,
crossing seas of blankness between.
The monochromatic
yellow shone on the human
faces that passed beneath the
lamps, robbing them of all
color, giving them a dead,
grayish appearance beneath
the yellow itself.</p>

<p>David Houston walked purposefully
along the pavement,
his hand jammed deep in his
overcoat pockets. One hand
held the control box for the
little earpiece he wore. He
kept moving the band selector,
listening for any sign
that the Psychodeviant Police
were suspicious of a Controller
in their midst.</p>

<p>If they were following him,
of course, they would use a
different scrambler circuit
than the one which was plugged
into his own unit, but he
would be able to hear the
gabble of voices, even if he
couldn't understand what they
were saying.</p>

<p>So far, there hadn't been a
sound; if he was being followed,
his tailers weren't
using the personal intercom
units.</p>

<p>He didn't try to elude anyone
who might be following.
That, in itself, would be a
giveaway. Let them watch, if
they <i>were</i> watching. They
wouldn't see anything but a
man going to get himself a bit
of dinner.</p>

<p>The <i>Charles II Inn</i>, on
Regent Street, near Piccadilly
Circus, was a haven of
brightness in an otherwise
Stygian London. It was one
of those "old-fashioned"
places&mdash;Restoration style of
decoration, carried out in
modern plastics. The oak
panelling looked authentic
enough, but it was just a little
too glossy to be real.</p>

<p>Houston pushed open the
door, stepped inside, removed
his hat and coat and shook the
dampness from them. As he
handed them to the checker,
he looked casually around.
Dorrine was nowhere in sight,
but he hadn't expected her to
be. There would be no point
in their meeting physically; it
might even be downright dangerous.</p>

<p>The headwaiter, clad in the
long waistcoat and full trunk-hose
of the late Seventeenth
Century, bowed punctiliously.</p>

<p>"You're alone, sir?"</p>

<p>"Alone, yes," Houston said.
"I'll just be wanting a light
supper and a drink or two."</p>

<p>"This way, sir."</p>

<p>Houston followed the man
to a small table in the rear of
the huge dining room. It was
set for two, but the other
place was quickly cleared
away. Houston ordered an
Irish-and-soda from a waiter
who was only slightly less
elaborately dressed than the
headwaiter, and then settled
himself down to wait. If he
knew Dorrine, she would be
on time to the minute.</p>

<p>She came while the waiter
was setting the drink on
Houston's table. She stepped
in through the door, her unmistakable
hair glowing a
rich red in the illumination of
the pseudo-candlelight.</p>

<p>She didn't bother to look
around; she knew he would be
there.</p>

<p>After a single glance, Houston
averted his eyes from her
and looked back at his drink.</p>

<p>And in that same instant,
their minds touched.</p>

<p><i>Dave, darling! I knew you'd
be early!</i></p>

<p><i>Dorrine!</i></p>

<p>And then their minds meshed
for an instant.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;<i>(we)</i>&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;LOVE&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;(each
other)&mdash;me!&mdash;us!</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston looked complacently
at his drink while the
headwaiter led Dorrine to a
table on the far side of the
room. She sat down gracefully,
smiled at the waiter, and
ordered a cocktail. Then she
took a magazine from her
handbag and began&mdash;presumably&mdash;to
read.</p>

<p>Her thought came: <i>Who is
this Richard Harris? He's not
one of our Group.</i></p>

<p>Houston sipped at his
drink. <i>No. An unknown, like
the others. I wonder if he's
even a telepath.</i></p>

<p><i>What?</i> Her thought carried
astonishment. <i>Why,
Dave&mdash;he'd</i> have <i>to be! How
else could he have controlled
this Sir Lewis&mdash;whatsisname&mdash;Huntley?</i></p>

<p><i>Well&mdash;I've got a funny idea</i>,
Houston replied. <i>Look at it
this way: So far as we know,
there are two Groups of telepaths.
There's our own Group.
All we want is to be left alone.
We don't read a Normal's
mind unless we have to, and
we don't try to control one unless
our lives are threatened.
We stay under cover, out of
everyone's way.</i></p>

<p><i>Then there are the megalomaniacs.
They try, presumably,
to gain wealth and
power by controlling Normals.
And they get caught
with monotonous regularity.
Right?</i></p>

<p>The girl caught an odd note
in that thought. <i>What do you
mean, "monotonous regularity"?</i>
she asked.</p>

<p><i>I mean</i>, Houston thought
savagely, <i>why is it they're all
so bloody stupid? Look at this
Harris guy; he is supposed to
have taken over Sir Lewis's
mind in order to get a thousand
pounds. So what did he
have Sir Lewis do? Parade all
around the city to pick up a
PD Police net, and then give
his address to a cabman in a
loud voice and lead the whole
net right to Harris! How stupid
can a man get?</i></p>

<p><i>It does look pretty silly</i>,
Dorrine agreed. <i>Have you got
an explanation?</i></p>

<p><i>Several</i>, Houston told her.
<i>And I don't know which one
is correct.</i></p>

<p><i>Let's have them</i>, the girl
thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston gave them to her.
None of them, he knew, was
completely satisfactory, but
they all made more sense that
the theory that Harris had
done what the PD Police
claimed he'd done.</p>

<p>Theory Number One: The
real megalomaniac Controller
had taken over Sir Lewis's
mind and made him draw out
the thousand pounds and head
west on Leadenhall Street.
Somehow, the Controller had
found out that Sir Lewis was
being followed, and had steered
him away from the original
destination, heading him
toward the innocent Robert
Harris. That implied that the
Controller had been within a
few dozen yards of the net
men that afternoon. A Controller
can't control a mind
directly from a distance, although
orders can be implanted
which will cause a man to
carry out a plan of action,
even though he may be miles
from the Controller. But in
order to change those plans,
the Controller would have to
be within projection range.</p>

<p>Theory Two: Robert Harris
actually was a megalomaniac
Controller; with a long record
of success behind him, who
had finally grown careless.</p>

<p>At that point, Dorrine interjected
a thought: <i>Isn't it
possible that he wanted to be
caught?</i></p>

<p>Houston mulled it over for
a minute. <i>A guilt-punishment
reaction? He wanted to be
punished for his crimes? I
suppose that might account
for part of it, yes. But if he'd
been so successful, what did
he do with all his money?</i></p>

<p>Dorrine gave a mental
shrug. <i>Who knows? What's
Theory Number Three?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>Number Three was the
screwiest one of all, yet it
made a weird kind of sense.
Suppose that Sir Lewis himself
had had a grudge against
Harris? The whole thing
would have been ridiculously
easy; all he'd have to do
would be to act just as he had
acted and then give evidence
against Harris.</p>

<p>The thing that made it odd
wasn't the actual frame-up (if
that's what it was); these
days, every crime was blamed
on a Controller. A man accused
of murder simply looked
virtuous and said that he
would never have done such a
thing if he hadn't been under
the power of a Controller.
Ditto for robbery, rape, and
any other felony you'd care to
name.</p>

<p>An aura of fear hung over
the whole Earth; each man
half suspected everyone with
whom he came in contact of
being a Controller.</p>

<p>So it wasn't that the frame-up
in itself was peculiar in
this case; it was simply that
it wasn't Sir Lewis Huntley's
style. If Sir Lewis had wanted
to get Harris, he'd have done
it legally, without any underhanded
frame-ups. Still, the
theory remained as a possibility.</p>

<p><i>I suppose it does</i>, Dorrine
agreed, <i>but how does that tie
in with our own Group? What
about Jackson and Marcy?
What happened to them?</i></p>

<p><i>I don't know</i>, Houston admitted,
<i>I just don't know</i>.</p>

<p>Jackson and Marcy had
been members of the Group of
telepaths who had banded together
for companionship and
mutual protection. Both of
them had been trapped by the
PD Police in exactly the same
way that Harris had been
trapped. They were now
where Harris would be in a
matter of hours&mdash;in the Penal
Cluster.</p>

<p>Their arrests didn't make
sense, either; they had been
accused of taking over someone's
mind for the purpose of
gaining money illegally&mdash;illegal,
that is, according to the
new UN laws that had been
passed to supersede the various
national laws that had
previously been in effect.</p>

<p>But Houston had known
both men well, and neither of
them was the kind of man who
would pull such a stunt, much
less do it in such a stupid manner.</p>

<p>Dorrine thought: <i>Well,
Dave, this Harris case is out
of our hands now; we've got
to concentrate on getting others
into the Group&mdash;we've got
to find the other sane ones.</i></p>

<p><i>You're ready to take over
here, then?</i> he asked.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the table, several yards
away from where Houston
was sitting, Dorrine, still
looking at the book, smiled
faintly.</p>

<p><i>I'll have to; you're being
transferred back to New York
at six in the morning.</i></p>

<p>Houston allowed a feeling of
startled surprise to bridge the
gap between their minds.
<i>How'd you know that?</i> He
hadn't told her, and she
couldn't have forced the
knowledge from his mind. A
telepath can open the mind of
a Normal as simply as he
might open the pages of a
book, but the mind of another
Controller is far stronger. One
telepath couldn't force anything
from the mind of another;
all thoughts had to be
exchanged voluntarily.</p>

<p>She was still smiling. <i>We've
got a few spies in the UN now</i>,
she told him. <i>I got the information
before you did.</i></p>

<p><i>You knew before you left
New York?</i> he asked incredulously.</p>

<p><i>That's right</i>, she thought.
<i>The decision was made last
night. Why?</i></p>

<p><i>Nothing</i>, he told her. <i>I was
just surprised, that's all.</i> But
deep behind the telepathic
barrier he had erected against
her probing mind, he was
thinking something else. He
had been assigned to London
to capture the Controller&mdash;then
unknown&mdash;who was said
to be active in England. But
his recall order had been decided
upon <i>before</i> Harris was
caught&mdash;or even suspected.
Someone in the UN Psychodeviant
Police Supreme Headquarters
in New York must
have known that Harris would
be caught that day!</p>

<p><i>Something's bothering you</i>,
Dorrine stated flatly.</p>

<p><i>I was thinking about leaving
London</i>, he replied evasively.
<i>I haven't seen you for
six months, and now I have to
leave again.</i></p>

<p><i>I'll be back in New York
within three weeks</i>, the girl
thought warmly. <i>I'll be&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Her thoughts were cut off
suddenly by a strident voice
in Houston's ear. "Attention;
all-band notice. Robert Bentley
Harris, arraigned this evening
on a charge of illegal use
of psychodeviant powers for
the purpose of compounding a
felony, has been found guilty
as charged. He was therefore
sentenced by the Lord Justice
of Her Majesty's Court of
Star Chamber to be banished
from Earth forever, such banishment
to be carried out by
the United Nations Penology
Service at the Queen's pleasure."</p>

<p>The words that were running
through Houston's brain,
had been transmitted easily to
Dorrine. For a moment,
neither of them made any
comment. Then Houston
glanced at his watch.</p>

<p><i>Twenty-one minutes</i>, he
thought bitterly. <i>What took
them so long?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>High in the thin ionosphere,
seventy miles above the surface
of the Earth, a fifteen-hundred-mile-an-hour
rocket
airliner winged its way westward
across the Atlantic,
pushing herself forward on
the thin, whispering, white-hot
jets of her atomic engine.
Behind her, the outdistanced
sun sank slowly below the
eastern horizon.</p>

<p>David Houston wasn't
watching the sunrise-in-reverse;
he was sitting quietly
in his seat, still trying to
puzzle out his queer recall to
New York. When Hamilton
had told him about it over the
phone, he'd assumed that New
York, having been notified
that Harris had been captured,
had decided to send for
Houston, now that his job was
over.</p>

<p>But now he knew that the
order had come through nearly
twenty-four hours before
Harris was captured.</p>

<p>Did someone at UN Headquarters
know that Harris
was going to be captured? Or
did someone there suspect
that there was something odd
about Police Operative David
Houston?</p>

<p>Or both?</p>

<p>Whatever it was, Houston
would have to take his
chances; to act suspiciously
would be a deadly mistake.</p>

<p>A stewardess, clad in the
chic BOAC uniform, moved
down the aisle, quietly informing
the passengers that they
could have coffee served at
their seats or take breakfast
in the lounge. The atmosphere
of the plane's interior was
filled with the low murmur of
a hundred conversations
against the background of the
susurrant mutter of the
mighty engines.</p>

<p><i>Uhhh&mdash;uh&mdash;uh&mdash;dizzy&mdash;head hurts&mdash;uh&mdash;uh&mdash;</i></p>

<p>The sounds in the plane altered
subtly as the faint
thought insinuated itself on
every brain inside the aircraft.
None of the Normal
passengers recognized it for
what it was; it was too gentle,
too weak, to be recognized
directly by their minds.</p>

<p>But David Houston recognized
it instantly for what it
was.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the plane, a
Controller had been unconscious.
<i>Had</i> been. For now, his
powerful mind was trying to
swim up from the black
depths of nothingness.</p>

<p><i>Uh&mdash;uhhhh&mdash;uhh&mdash;</i></p>

<p>The Normal passengers became
uneasy, not knowing
why they were disturbed. To
them, it was like a vaguely unpleasant
but totally unrecognizable
nudge from their
own subconscious, like some
long-forgotten and deeply
buried memory that had been
forced down into oblivion and
was now trying to obtrude itself
on the conscious mind.</p>

<p><i>Uhhh&mdash;Oooohh&mdash;where?&mdash;what
happened?&mdash;</i></p>

<p>A fully conscious telepath
could project his thoughts
along a narrow locus, focusing
them on a single brain,
leaving all other brains oblivious
to his thoughts. Like a
TV broadcasting station, he
could choose his wavelength
and stick to it.</p>

<p>But a half-conscious Controller
sprayed his thoughts at
random, creating mental disturbances
in his vicinity. Like
a thunderstorm creating radio
static, there was no selectivity.</p>

<p>Savagely, David Houston
did what he had to do. It
might be a trap, but he had
to avoid the carnage that
might follow if this went on.
He hurled a beam of thought,
hard-held, at the offending
mind of the awakening telepath.</p>

<p><i>DON'T THINK! RELAX!</i></p>

<p>Normally it was impossible
for a Controller to take over
the mind of another Controller,
but these were abnormal
circumstances; the half-conscious
man, whoever he was,
was weakened mentally by
some kind of enforced unconsciousness&mdash;either
a drug or a
stun gun. Houston took over
his mind smoothly and easily.</p>

<p><i>Robert Harris!</i></p>

<p>Houston recognized the
mind as soon as he held it.</p>

<p>He didn't try to force anything
on Harris's mind; he
simply held it, cradling it,
helping Harris to regain consciousness
easily, bringing
him up from the darkness
gently.</p>

<p>In normal sleep, everyone's
mind retains a certain amount
of self-control and awareness
of environment. If it didn't,
noise and bright lights
wouldn't awaken a sleeping
person.</p>

<hr />

<p>In normal sleep, a telepath
retained enough control to
keep his thoughts to himself,
even when waking up.</p>

<p>But total anaesthesia
brought on a mental blackout
from which the victim recovered
only with effort. And
during that time, a Controller's
mind was violently disturbing
to the Normal minds
around him, who mistook his
disordered thoughts for their
own.</p>

<p>Like pouring heavy oil on
choppy waters, Houston
soothed the disturbances of
Harris's mind, focusing the
random broadcasts on his own
brain.</p>

<p>And while he did that, he
probed gently into the weakened
mind of the prisoner for
information.</p>

<p>Harris was a Controller, all
right; there was no doubt
about that. But nowhere in his
mind was there any trace of
any knowledge of what had
happened to Sir Lewis Huntley.
If Sir Lewis had actually
been controlled, it hadn't been
done by Robert Harris.</p>

<p>Houston wished he'd been
able to probe Sir Lewis's
mind; he'd have been able to
get a lot more information
out of it than he had in his
possession now. But that
would have been dangerous;
if Sir Lewis was a Controller
himself, and had been acting
a part, Houston would have
given himself away the instant
he attempted to touch
the baronet's mind. If, on the
other hand, Sir Lewis had actually
been under the control
of another telepath, any probing
into the mind of the puppet
would have betrayed
Houston to the real Controller.</p>

<p>Harris knew nothing. He
wasn't acquainted with any
other Controllers, and had
kept his nose clean ever since
he'd discovered his latent
powers. He knew that megalomaniac
Controllers were
either captured or mobbed,
and he had no wish to experience
either.</p>

<p>The Normals had long since
discovered that the only way
to overcome a Controller was
by force of numbers. A Controller
could only hold one
Normal mind at a time. That
was why a mob could easily
kill a single Controller; that
was why the Psychodeviant
Police had evolved the "net"
system for arresting a telepath.</p>

<p>Harris, then, had been
framed. Or could it be called
a frame-up when Harris was
really guilty of the actual
crime? Because the crime he
had really been accused of
was not that of controlling
Sir Lewis, but the crime of
being a telepath. That, and
that alone, damned him in the
eyes of the Normals; the
crime of taking over a mind
for gain was incidental. The
stigma lies in what he <i>was</i>, not
what he did.</p>

<p>Harris himself was in the
bottom of the plane, in the
baggage section near the
landing gear. After his trial,
still drugged, he had been secretly
put aboard, to be taken
to the Long Island Spaceport
in New York. It had had to be
secret; no Normal would
knowingly ride on an aircraft
which carried a Controller,
even if he were drugged into
total unconsciousness.</p>

<p>With Harris were two PD
Police guards. Their low conversation
impinged on Harris's
ears, and was transmitted
to Houston's mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one of them said:
"Hey! He's moving!"</p>

<p>"Better give him another
shot, Harry;" said the other,
"when those guys wake up,
they drive you crazy."</p>

<p>Houston could almost feel
the sting of the needle as it
was inserted into the arm of
the helpless prisoner.</p>

<p>Slowly, Harris's thoughts,
which had begun to become
fully coherent, again became
chaotic, finally sliding off into
silence and darkness.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, sir?"</p>

<p>Houston looked up from his
intense concentration. The
stewardess was standing by
his seat. He realized that there
was a film of perspiration on
his brow, and that he probably
had looked dazed while
he was concentrating on Harris's
mind.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said quickly,
"I'm all right. I'm just a little
tired. Had to get up too early
to catch this plane." He rubbed
his forehead. "I do have a
little headache; would you
happen to have any aspirin
aboard?"</p>

<p>She smiled professionally.
"Certainly, sir. I'll get a couple
of tablets."</p>

<p>As she left for the first-aid
cabinet, Houston thought
bleakly to himself: <i>Harris
was framed. Possibly others
have been, too. But by whom?
And why?</i></p>

<p>He could see why a Normal
might do such a thing. But
why would a Controller do it?</p>

<p>There was only one answer.
Somewhere, there was a Controller,
or a group of Controllers
who were megalomaniacs
<i>par excellence</i>. If that were
so, he&mdash;or they&mdash;could make
the late "Blackjack" Donnely
look like a meek, harmless,
little mouse.</p>

<hr />

<p>The one part of Continental
U.S.A. over which the American
Government had no jurisdiction
was small, areawise,
in comparison with its power.
The District of the United
Nations occupied the small
area of Manhattan Island
which ran from 38th Street on
the south to 49th Street on
the north; its western border
was Third Avenue, its eastern,
the East River. From here,
the UN ruled Earth.</p>

<p>There were no walls or
fences around it; only by
looking at street signs could
anyone tell that they had
crossed an international border.
Crossing Third Avenue
from west to east, one found
that 45th Street had suddenly
become Deutschland Strasse;
40th Street became Rue de
France; 47th was the Via
Italiano. 43rd Street's sign
was painted in Cyrillic characters,
but beneath it, in English,
were the words "Avenue
of Mother Russia."</p>

<p>Third Avenue was technically
One World Drive. Second
Avenue was labelled as
Planetary Peace Drive, and
First was United Nations
Drive.</p>

<p>But New Yorkers are, and
always have been, diehards.
Just as The Avenue of the
Americas had forever remained
Sixth Avenue, no matter
what the maps called it, so
had the other streets retained
their old names in conversation.</p>

<p>Even the International Post
Office, after years of wrangling,
had given up, and letters
addressed to <i>Supreme
Headquarters, United Nations
Police, 45th Street at Second
Avenue</i>, were delivered without
comment, even though the
IPO still firmly held that they
were technically misaddressed.
And, privately, even the
IPO officials admitted that the
numbers were easier to say
and remember than the polyglot
street names that had
been tagged on by the General
Assembly.</p>

<p>So when David Houston signalled
a taxi at Grand Central
Station and said, "Forty-fifth
and Second," the driver simply
set his automatic controls,
leaned back in his seat, and
said, "Goin' to see the cops,
huh?"</p>

<p>When no answer was forthcoming,
the driver turned
around and took a good look
at his passenger. "Maybe
you're a UN cop yourself,
huh?"</p>

<p>Houston shook his head.
"Nope. Some kids have been
scribbling dirty words on my
sidewalk, and I'm going to report
it to the authorities."</p>

<p>The driver turned back
around and looked ahead
again. "Jeez! That's serious.
Hadn't you better take it up
with the Secretary General?
I wouldn't be satisfied with no
underlings in a case like
that."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of taking it
up with the Atomic Energy
Control Board," Houston told
him. "I think those kids are
using radioactive chalk."</p>

<p>"That's one way for 'em to
get blue jeans," said the
driver cryptically.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment
as the taxi braked
smoothly to a halt, guided and
controlled by the automatic
machinery in the hood.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the driver
said: "Ship up!" He pointed
east, along 45th Street, toward
Long Island. Far in the
distance was a rapidly rising
vapor trail, pointing vertically
toward the sky, the
unmistakable sign of a spaceship
takeoff. They didn't leave
often, and it was still an unusual
sight.</p>

<p>Houston said nothing as he
climbed out and paid the
driver, tossing in an extra tip.</p>

<p>"Thanks, buddy," said the
driver. "Watch out for them
kids."</p>

<p>Houston didn't answer. He
was still watching the vapor
trail as the cab pulled away.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>There goes Harris</i>, he was
thinking. <i>An innocent man,
guilty of nothing more than
being born different. And because
of that, he's labelled as
an inhuman monster, not
even worthy of being executed.
Instead, he's taken into
space, filled full of hibernene,
and chained to a floating piece
of rock for the rest of his life.</i></p>

<p>Such was humanity's "humane"
way of taking care of
the bogey of Controllers. Capital
punishment had been
outlawed all over Earth; it
had long since been proved
that legalized murder, execution
by the State, solved nothing,
helped no one, prevented
no crimes, and did infinitely
more harm than good in the
long run.</p>

<p>With the coming of the
Controllers, a movement had
arisen to bring back the old
evil of judicial murder, but it
had been quickly put down
when the Penal Cluster plan
had been put forth as a more
"humane" method.</p>

<p>Hibernene was a drug that
had been evolved from the
study of animals like the bear,
which spent its winters in an
almost death-like sleep. A human
being, given a proper
dosage of the drug, lapsed
into a deep coma. The bodily
processes were slowed down;
the heart throbbed sluggishly,
once every few minutes;
thought ceased. It was the
ideal prison for a mental offender
that ordinary prisons
could not hold.</p>

<p>But it wasn't quite enough
for the bloodthirsty desire for
vengeance that the Normals
held for the Controllers. There
had to be more.</p>

<p>Following Earth in its orbit
around the sun, trailing it
by some ninety-three million
miles, were a group of tiny
asteroids, occupying what is
known as the Trojan position.
They were invisible from
Earth, being made of dark
rock and none of them being
more than fifteen feet in
diameter. But they had been
a source of trouble in some of
the early expeditions to Mars,
and had been carefully charted
by the Space Commission.</p>

<p>Now a use had been found
for them. A man in a spacesuit
could easily be chained to
one of them. With him was a
small, sun-powered engine and
tanks of liquified food concentrates
and oxygen. Kept under
the influence of hibernene,
and kept cool by the chill of
space, a man could spend the
rest of his life there&mdash;unmoving,
unknowing, uncaring,
dead as far as he and the rest
of Mankind were concerned&mdash;his
slight bodily needs tended
automatically by machine.</p>

<p>It was a punishment that
satisfied both sides of the life-or-death
argument.</p>

<p>Houston shook off the bleak,
black feeling of terrible chill
that had crept over him and
pushed his way into the UN
Police building.</p>

<hr />

<p>The thirteenth floor housed
the Psychodeviant Division.
As he stood in the rising elevator,
Houston wondered wryly
if the number 13 was good
luck or bad in this case.</p>

<p>He stepped out of the elevator
and headed for the
Division Chief's office.</p>

<p>Division Chief Reinhardt
was a heavy-set, balding man,
built like a professional
wrestler. His cold blue eyes
gleamed from beneath shaggy,
overhanging brows, and his
face was almost expressionless
except for a faint scowl
that crossed it from time to
time. In spite of the fact that
a Canadian education had
wiped out all but the barest
trace of German accent, his
Prussian training, of the old
Junkers school, was still evident.
He demanded&mdash;and got&mdash;precision
and obedience
from his subordinates, although
he had no use for the
strictly military viewpoint of
obsequiousness towards one's
superiors.</p>

<p>He was sitting behind his
desk, scowling slightly at some
papers on it when Houston
stepped in.</p>

<p>"You wanted me to report
straight to you, Mr. Reinhardt?"</p>

<p>Reinhardt looked up, his
heavy face becoming expressionless.
"Ah, Houston. Yes;
sit down. You did a fine job
on that London affair; that's
what I call coming through at
the last moment."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Your orders to return," he
said, "were cut before you
found your man. We have a
much more important case
for you than some petty pilfering
Controller. We are
after much more dangerous
game."</p>

<p>Houston nodded. "I see."
Inwardly, he wondered. It
was almost as if Reinhardt
knew that Houston had found
out that the recall had come
early. Houston would have
given his right arm at that
moment to be able to probe
Reinhardt's mind. But he held
himself back. He had, in the
past, sent tentative probes toward
the Division Chief and
found nothing, but he didn't
know whether it would be safe
now or not. It would be better
to wait.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reinhardt stood up, walked
to the wall, and turned on a
display screen. He twisted
a knob to a certain setting,
and a map of Manhattan Island
sprang onto the screen in
glowing color.</p>

<p>"As you know," Reinhardt
said pedantically, "no Controller
can do a perfect job of
controlling a normal person.
No matter how much he may
want to make John Smith act
naturally, some of the personality
of the Controller will
show up in the actions of
John Smith. Am I correct?"</p>

<p>Houston nodded without
saying anything. The question
was purely rhetorical, and the
statement was perfectly correct.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," Reinhardt
continued, "by means of
these peculiarities, our psychologists
have found that
there is widespread, but very
subtle controlling going on
right in the UN General Assembly
itself! The amazing
thing is that they all bear the&mdash;shall
we say&mdash;trademark of
the same Controller. Whoever
he is, he seems to have a long-range
plan in mind; he wants
to change, ever so slightly,
certain international laws so
that he will profit by them. Do
you follow?"</p>

<p>"I follow," said Houston.</p>

<p>"Good. It has taken painstaking
research and a great
deal of psychological statistical
analysis, but we have
found that one company&mdash;and
one company only&mdash;benefits
by these legal changes. Did
you ever hear of Lasser &amp;
Sons?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Houston.
"They're in the import-export
business, with a few fingers in
shipping and air transport."</p>

<p>"That's them," said Reinhardt.
"Someone in that company,
presumably someone at
the top, is a Controller. And
he's a very subtle, very dangerous
man. Unlike the others,
there is nothing hasty or
overt in his plans. But within
a few years, if this goes on,
he will have more power than
the others ever dreamed of."</p>

<p>"And my job is to get him?"
Houston asked.</p>

<p>Reinhardt nodded. "That's
it. Get him. One way or another.
You're in charge; I
don't care how you do it, but
this one Controller is more
dangerous than any other
we've come across, so get
him."</p>

<p>Houston nodded slowly.
"Okay. Can you give me all
the data you have so far?"</p>

<p>Reinhardt patted a heavy
folder on his desk. "It's all
here." Then he tapped the
projected map on the screen.
"That's the Lasser Building&mdash;Church
Street at Worth.
Somewhere in there is the
man we're looking for."</p>

<hr />

<p>David Houston spent the
next six weeks gathering
facts, trying to determine the
identity of the mysterious
Controller at Lasser &amp; Sons.
Slowly, the evidence began to
pile up.</p>

<p>At the same time, he worried
over his own problem.
Who was betraying non-criminal
Controllers to the PD Police?</p>

<p>In that six-week period,
two more men and a woman
were arrested&mdash;one in Spain,
one in India, and one in
Hawaii.</p>

<p>There weren't very many
Controllers on Earth, percentagewise.
Of the three and a
half billion people on Earth,
less than an estimated one-thousandth
of one percent
were telepathic. But that made
a grand total of some thirty-five
thousand people.</p>

<p>Spread, as they were, all
over the planet, it was rare
that one Controller ever met
another. The intelligent ones
didn't use their power; they
remained concealed, even
from each other.</p>

<p>But <i>someone</i>, somewhere,
was finding them and betraying
them to the Psychodeviant
Police.</p>

<p>As more and more data
came in on the Lasser case,
Houston began to get an idea.
If there were a really clever,
highly intelligent, megalomaniac
Controller, wouldn't it
be part of his psychological
pattern to attempt to get rid
of the majority of Controllers,
those who simply wanted to
lead normal lives?</p>

<p>And, if so, wasn't it possible
that both his cases&mdash;the
official and the unofficial&mdash;might
lead to the same place:
Lasser &amp; Sons?</p>

<p>It began to look as though
Houston could kill both his
birds at once, if he could just
figure out when, how, and in
what direction to throw the
stone.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventh
week, a Controller in
Manchester, England, was
mobbed and torn to bits by an
irate crowd before the PD Police
could get to him. There
was no doubt in Houston's
mind that this one was a real
megalomaniac; he had taken
over another man's brain and
forced him to commit suicide.
The controlled man had taken
a Webley automatic, put it to
his temple, and blown his
brains out.</p>

<p>The Controller's mistake
was in not realizing what the
sudden shock of that bullet,
transmitted to him telepathically,
could do to his own mind.
In the mental disorder that
followed, he was spotted and
killed easily.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was still no word
from Dorrine. She had flown
back to the States a week after
Houston had returned, but
she had had to get back to
England after three days.
Since then, he had had three
letters, nothing more. And
letters are a damned unsatisfactory
way for a telepath to
conduct a love affair.</p>

<p>The one other factor that
entered in was The Group, the
small band of sane, reasonable
telepaths who had begun to
build themselves into an organization&mdash;a
sort of Mutual
Protective Association.</p>

<p>Personally, Houston didn't
think much of the idea; the
Group didn't have any real organization,
and they refused
to put one together. It was
supposed to be democratic, but
it sometimes bordered on the
anarchic.</p>

<p>He stayed with them more
for companionship than any
other reason. When Dorrine
had come back for her short
stay, Houston had met with
them and tried to get them to
help him trace down the megalomaniac
Controller who
was doing so much damage,
but they'd balked at the idea.
Their job, they claimed, was
to get enough members so that
they could protect themselves
from arrest by the Normals,
and then just let things ride.</p>

<p>"After all," Dorrine had
said, "things will work themselves
out, darling; they always
do."</p>

<p>"Not unless somebody helps
them, they don't," Houston
had snapped back. "Someone
has to do something."</p>

<p>"But, Dave, darling&mdash;we
<i>are</i> doing something! Don't
you see?"</p>

<p>He didn't, but there was no
convincing either the Group
or Dorrine. She was passionately
interested in the recruiting
work she was doing, and
she thought that the Group
was the answer to every Controller's
troubles.</p>

<p>And then she had rushed
back to England. "I'll be back
soon, Dave," she'd said. "I
think I have a lead on a girl
in Liverpool."</p>

<p>So far, the girl hadn't been
found. Controllers didn't like
to give themselves away to
anyone, so they kept a tight
screen up most of the time.</p>

<p>It seemed as though everyone
on Earth was in deadly
fear all the time. The Normals
feared losing their identities
to Controllers, and the Controllers
feared death at the
hands of the Normals.</p>

<p>And death or the Penal
Cluster were their only
choices if they were discovered.</p>

<p>Houston worried about the
risks Dorrine was taking, but
there was nothing he could do.
She was doing what she
thought was right, just as he
was; how could he argue with
that?</p>

<p>Houston went on with his
job, putting together facts and
rumors and statistical data
analysis, searching out his
quarry.</p>

<p>And, at the end of the
eighth week, everything blew
high, wide, and hellish.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was late evening. A cool
wind blew over New York,
bringing with it a hint of the
rain to come. Church Street,
in lower Manhattan, was not
crowded, as it had been in the
late afternoon, but neither
was it entirely deserted. The
cafes and bars did a lively
business, but the tall, many-colored
office buildings gaped
at the street with blind and
darkened eyes. Only a few of
the windows glowed whitely
with fluorescent illumination.</p>

<p>In one of the small coffee
shops, David Houston sat,
smoking a cigarette and stirring
idly at a cup of cooling
coffee.</p>

<p>Across the street was the
Lasser Building; high up on
the sixtieth floor, a whole
suite of offices was brightly
lit. The rest of the building
was clothed in blackness.</p>

<p>Who was up there in that
suite? Houston wasn't quite
sure. He had narrowed his list
of suspects down to three
men: John Sager, Loris Pederson,
and Norcross Lasser,
three top officials in the company.
Sager and Pederson
were both vice-presidents of
the firm; Sager was in charge
of the Foreign Exports department,
while Pederson
handled the actual shipping.
Lasser, by virtue of being the
grandson of the man who had
founded the firm, was president
of Lasser &amp; Sons, Inc.</p>

<p>Lasser seemed like a poor
choice as chief villain of the
outfit; he was a mild, bland
man, quiet and friendly. Besides,
his position made him
an obvious suspect; naturally,
the majority stockholder of
the firm would profit most by
the increased power of the
company. And, equally obviously,
a Controller wouldn't
want to put himself in such an
exposed position.</p>

<p>Which made Lasser, in
Houston's mind, a hell of a
good suspect. If anything happened,
Lasser could cover by
claiming that he, too, had been
controlled, and the chances
were that he could get away
with it. A Controller never
did anything directly; their
dirty work was done by someone
else&mdash;a puppet under
their mental control. At least,
so ran the popular misconception.
If Lasser were the man,
he stood a good chance of getting
away with it, even if he
were caught, provided he
played his cards right.</p>

<hr />

<p>That reasoning still didn't
eliminate Sager or Pederson.
Either of them could be the
Controller. And there still remained
the possibility that
some unknown, unsuspected
fourth person had the company
of Lasser &amp; Sons under
his thumb.</p>

<p>That was what Houston intended
to find out tonight.</p>

<p>He took a sip of his coffee,
found it still reasonably hot.</p>

<p>Damn the megalomaniacs,
anyway! Houston subconsciously
tightened his fists.
He, personally, had more to
fear from the Normals than
from another Controller. Normals
could kill or imprison
him, while a Controller would
have a hard time doing either,
directly.</p>

<p>But Houston could understand
the Normal man; he
could see how fear of a Controller
could drive a man without
the ability into a frenzied
panic. He could understand,
even forgive their actions,
born and bred in ignorance
and fear.</p>

<p>No, the ones he hated were
the ones who had conceived
and fostered that fear&mdash;the
psychologically unstable megalomaniac
Controllers. There
were only a handful of them&mdash;probably
not more than a
few hundred or a thousand.
But because of them, every
telepath on Earth found his
life in danger, and every Normal
found his life a hell of
terror.</p>

<p>Let Dorrine and her do-nothing
friends run around
the globe recruiting members
for their precious Group; that
was all right for them. Meanwhile,
David Houston would
be doing something on a more
basic action level.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.
Almost time.</p>

<p>"How's the deployment?"
he whispered in his throat.</p>

<p>"We've got the building surrounded
now," said the voice
in his ear. "You can go in anytime."</p>

<p>"How about the roof?"</p>

<p>"That's taken care of, sir;
we've got 'copter that can be
on the top of the Lasser Building
at any time you call. They
can land within thirty seconds
of your signal."</p>

<p>"Okay," Houston said; "I'm
going in now. Remember&mdash;no
matter what I say or do, no
one is to leave that building
if they're conscious. And keep
your eyes on me; if I act in
the least peculiar, handcuff
me&mdash;but don't knock me out.</p>

<p>"And if I'm not back on
time, come in anyway."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston finished his coffee,
dropped a coin on the counter,
and headed for the other side
of the street.</p>

<p>The big problem was getting
into the building itself.
It was ringed with alarms;
Lasser &amp; Sons didn't want just
anybody wandering in and out
of their building.</p>

<p>So Houston had arranged a
roundabout way. The building
next to the Lasser Building
was a good deal smaller, only
forty-five stories high. A week
before, Houston had rented an
office on the eighteenth floor
of the building; on the door,
he had already had a sign engraved:
Ajax Enterprises.</p>

<p>It was a shame the office
would never be used.</p>

<p>Houston walked straight to
the next-door building and
opened the front door with his
key. Inside, a night watchman
lounged behind a desk, smoking
a blackened briar. He
looked up, smiled, and nodded.</p>

<p>"Evening, Mr. Griswold;
working late tonight?"</p>

<p>Houston forced a smile he
did not feel. "Just doing a
little paper work," he said.</p>

<p>He took the automatic elevator
to the eighteenth floor. He
didn't relish the idea of walking
up to the roof, but taking
the elevator would make the
nightwatchman suspicious.</p>

<p>He didn't bother going to
the office; he headed directly
for the stairway and began
his long climb&mdash;twenty-seven
floors to the roof.</p>

<p>All through it, he kept up a
running comment through his
throat mike. "I wish I weighed
about fifty pounds less;
carrying two hundred and
twenty pounds of blubber up
these stairs isn't easy."</p>

<p>"Blubber, hooey!" the earphone
interrupted. "Any man
who's six-feet-three has a
right to carry that much
weight. Actually, you're a
skinny-looking sort of goop."</p>

<p>Both men were exaggerating;
Houston wasn't fat, but
his broad, powerful frame
couldn't be called skinny,
either.</p>

<p>When he finally reached the
roof, he paused and surveyed
the wall of the Lasser Building,
which towered high above
him, spearing an additional
thirty stories in the air. Up
there, the lights on the sixtieth
floor gleamed in the
night.</p>

<p>The air was growing cooler,
and the beginnings of a
mist were forming. Houston
hoped it wouldn't start to rain
before he got inside.</p>

<hr />

<p>The forty-sixth floor of the
Lasser Building had no windows
on this side, but there
were plenty on the forty-seventh.</p>

<p>Leading up to them was an
inviting looking fire escape,
but Houston knew he didn't
dare take that. By law, every
fire escape was rigged with a
fire alarm, in addition to the
regular burglar alarm. He'd
have to use another way.</p>

<p>The Lasser Building was a
steel structure, shelled over
with a bright blue anodized
aluminum sheath. Only the
day before, Houston, wearing
the gray coverall of a power-line
workman, had checked
the wall to find the big steel
beams beneath the aluminum.
He had also installed certain
other equipment; now he was
going to make use of it.</p>

<p>Concealed in the louvres of
the air-conditioner intake of
the lower building was a specially
constructed suit and
several hundred feet of power
line which was connected to
the main line of the building.</p>

<p>In the darkness, Houston
slipped on the suit. It was constructed
somewhat like a light
diving suit or a spacesuit, but
without the helmet. In the
toes, knees, and hands, were
powerful electromagnets controlled
by switches in the fingers
of the gloves and powered
by the current in the long
line.</p>

<p>Houston stepped over to the
blue aluminum wall, reached
out a hand, and lowered one
finger. Instantly, the powerful
magnet anchored his hand to
the wall, held by the dense
magnetic field to the steel
beam beneath the aluminum
sheath. That one magnet alone
could support his full body
weight, and he had six magnets
to work with.</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, David
Houston began to crawl up the
wall.</p>

<p>Turn on a magnet in the
right hand; lift up the left
hand and anchor it higher;
turn on the right hand and
lift it even with the left, then
anchor it again; do the same
with both legs; then begin the
process all over again, turning
the magnets off and on in
rotation.</p>

<p>Up and up he went. Past
the forty-sixth floor, past the
forty-seventh, the forty-eighth,
and the forty-ninth.
Not until he reached the fiftieth
floor did he attempt to
open one of the windows.</p>

<p>There was a magnetic lock
inside the window, but Houston
had taken that, too, into
account. The powerful magnet
in his right glove slid it aside
easily. Houston lifted the window
and stepped inside.</p>

<p>He had ten more floors to
go.</p>

<p>He took off the suit and
rolled it up into a tight package,
then dropped it out the
window. It landed with a
barely audible thump. Houston
took a deep breath, drew
his stun gun, and headed for
the stairway.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the landing of the sixtieth
floor of the Lasser
Building, David Houston
paused for a moment.</p>

<p>"Sounds like you're out of
breath," said the voice in his
ear.</p>

<p>"You try climbing all that
way sometime," Houston
whispered. "I'm no superman,
you know."</p>

<p>"Shucks," said the voice,
"you've disillusioned me.
What now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to get a
little information," Houston
told him. "Hold on."</p>

<p>On the other side of the
door, he could hear faint
sound, as if someone were
moving around, but he could
hear no voices.</p>

<p>Carefully, he sent out a
probing thought, trying to see
if he could attune his mind
with that of someone inside
without betraying himself.</p>

<p>He couldn't detect anything.
The sixtieth floor covered a
lot of space; if whoever was
inside was too far away, their
thoughts would be too faint to
pick up unless Houston stepped
up his own power, and he
didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>Cautiously, he reached out
a hand and eased open the
door.</p>

<p>The hallway was brightly
lit, but there was no one in
sight. The unaccustomed light
made Houston blink for a moment
before his eyes adjusted
to it; the hallways and landings
below had been pitch
dark, forcing him to use a
penlight to find his way up.</p>

<p>He stepped into the hallway,
closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p>Now he could hear voices.
He stopped to listen. The
conversation was coming
from an office down the hall&mdash;if
it could be called a conversation.</p>

<p>There would be long periods
of silence, then a word or
two: "But not that way."
"Until tomorrow." "Vacillates."</p>

<p>There were three different
voices.</p>

<p>Houston moved on down the
hall, his stun gun ready. A few
yards from the door, he stopped
again, and, very gently, he
sent out another thought-probe,
searching for the
minds of those within, carefully
forging his way.</p>

<hr />

<p>And, at that crucial instant,
a voice spoke in his ear.</p>

<p>"Houston! What's going
on? You haven't said a thing
for two full minutes!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right!" Houston
snapped. Only the force of
long training and habit kept
him from shouting the words
aloud instead of keeping them
to a subvocal whisper.</p>

<p>"All right or not," said the
other, "we're coming in in
seven minutes, as ordered.
Meanwhile, there's a news
bulletin for you; the British
division has picked up another
Controller&mdash;a woman named
Dorrine Kent. Two in one
night ought to be a pretty
good bag."</p>

<p>For a moment, Houston's
mind was a meaningless blur.</p>

<p><i>Dorrine!</i></p>

<p>And then another voice
broke through his shock.</p>

<p>"Dear me, sir! Calm yourself!
You're positively fizzing!"</p>

<p>Houston jerked. Standing
in the doorway of the office
was Norcross Lasser, with a
benign smile on his face and
a deadly-looking .38 automatic
in his hand. Behind him stood
John Sager and Loris Pederson,
their faces wary.</p>

<p>"Please drop that stun gun,
Mr. Cop."</p>

<hr />

<p>In those few moments,
Houston had regained control
of himself. He realized
what had happened. The interruption
of his thought-probe
had startled him just a
little, but that little had been
enough to warn the Controller.</p>

<p>He wondered which of the
three men was the actual Controller.</p>

<p>He began to lower his
weapon, then, suddenly, with
all the force and hatred he
could muster, he sent a blistering,
shocking thought toward
the man with the gun.</p>

<p>Lasser staggered as though
he'd been struck. His gun
wavered, and Houston fired
quickly with his stun gun. At
the same time, Lasser's automatic
went off.</p>

<p>The bullet went wild, and
the stun beam didn't do much
better. It struck Lasser's
hand, paralyzing it, but it
didn't knock out Lasser.</p>

<p>The mental battle that ensued
only took a half second,
but at the speed of thought, a
lot of things can happen in a
half second.</p>

<p>Houston realized almost instantaneously
that he had
made a vast mistake. He had
badly underestimated the
enemy.</p>

<p>There was no need to worry,
now, about which one of the
men was a Controller&mdash;<i>all
three of them were!</i></p>

<p>As soon as Sager and Pederson
realized what had happened,
they leaped&mdash;mentally&mdash;into
the battle. Lasser, already
weakened by the unexpected
mental blow from
Houston, lost consciousness
when the others let loose their
blasts because his mind was
still linked with Houston's,
and he absorbed a great deal
of the mental energy meant
for Houston's brain.</p>

<p>Houston, fully warned by
now, held up a denial wall
which screened his mind from
the worst that Sager and Pederson
could put out, but he
knew he couldn't hold out for
long.</p>

<p>"Come in&mdash;<i>now!</i>" he said
hoarsely into the microphone.</p>

<p>"Stupid swine!" Sager susurrated
sibilantly.</p>

<p>Pederson said nothing
aloud, but his brain was blazing
with fear and hatred. His
gun hand jerked towards a
holster under his arm. Lasser
was still crumpling towards
the floor.</p>

<p>The entire action had taken
less than a second.</p>

<p>Houston tried to fire again
with his stun gun, but it required
every bit of concentration
he could sum up to hold
off the combined mental assaults
of Sager and Pederson.</p>

<p>But they, too, were at somewhat
of a disadvantage. In
order to keep all their efforts
concentrated on the PD policeman,
both Controllers had
to refrain from putting too
much attention on their bodily
motions. Pederson was still
fumbling for his gun, and
Sager hadn't yet started for
his.</p>

<p>Lasser barely touched the
floor before his consciousness
began to return. The resulting
fraction of a second of mental
static afforded Houston a
brief respite; it disturbed
Pederson just as he was getting
his fingers on the butt of
his weapon.</p>

<p>Both Controllers were focusing
their mental energies
on Houston's brain, and during
the brief respite, Houston
made one vital mental adjustment.
He allowed both
thought-probes to fuse in a
small part of his consciousness.
They went <i>through</i> him
and lashed back at the two
Controllers.</p>

<p>Both of them had had their
minds tuned to Houston's, and
in that instant they found
they, were also attuned to
each other.</p>

<p>The resultant of the energy
was shocking to Houston, but
it was infinitely worse for
Sager and Pederson, since
neither of them had been expecting
it. Pederson, who had
already been slightly distracted,
got the major brunt of the
force. He managed to jerk his
gun free, but his brain was already
lapsing into unconsciousness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston's fingers tightened
on his own weapon. It fired
once at Lasser, who was trying
to lift himself from the
floor. Then it swept up and
coughed again, dropping Pederson.
His pistol barked
once, sending a singing
ricochet along the hall.</p>

<p>Sager, who had staggered
to one side when he and Pederson
had short-circuited
each other, had time to get behind
the protection of the office
door. He couldn't close it
because Lasser's and Pederson's
inert forms blocked the
doorway, but at least it afforded
protection against
Houston's stun gun.</p>

<p>His thought came through
to Houston: <i>So the stupid
Normals have a Controller
working for them! Traitor!</i></p>

<p><i>You're the traitor</i>, Houston
thought coldly. <i>You and your
megalomaniac friends. It's
madmen like you who have
made telepaths hated and
feared by the Normals.</i></p>

<p><i>And so they should hate and
fear us</i>, came the snarling
mental answer. <i>Within a few
generations, we will have supplanted
them. We will control
Earth&mdash;not they.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>The exchange had only
taken a fraction of a second.
Houston was already charging
toward the open door, hoping
to get inside before Sager
could reach a weapon.</p>

<p><i>You call me a traitor</i>, Houston
thought, <i>but you have
been framing innocent Controllers,
putting them into the
hands of the PD Police</i>.</p>

<p><i>That's a lie!</i> the reply came
hotly. <i>We would never betray
another telepath to the stupid
Normals! If a telepath were
so bullheaded as to get in our
way, we'd dispose of him. But
it would be Controller justice;
we wouldn't turn him over to
animals!</i></p>

<p>In one blazing moment,
Houston realized that the
Controller was telling the
truth!</p>

<p>No mental communication
can be expressed properly in
words. In, behind, and around
each statement, other, dimmer
nuances of thought gleam
through. Each thought tells
the receiver much more than
can be put down in crude verbal
symbols.</p>

<p>Thus, Houston already
knew that Lasser, Sager, and
Pederson were the three top
men in a world-wide clique
of megalomaniac Controllers.
This was the top of the madmen's
organization; these
three were the <i>creme de la
creme</i> of the Normal human's
real enemies.</p>

<p>He knew that there were
twelve others scattered over
Earth, and he knew where and
who they were. That brief exchange
had brought all the information
into Houston's own
mind as it leaked from the
minds of the others. He knew
it without thinking about how
he knew it.</p>

<p>And they were <i>not</i> the ones
who had been turning the
sane Controllers over to the
Psychodeviant Police!</p>

<p>Then who was? And why?</p>

<p>Houston was right back
where he had started.</p>

<p>But that brief instant of
confusion was Houston's
downfall. Sager instantly
realized that he had delivered,
inadvertently, a telling blow
to Houston's mind.</p>

<p>Physically, Houston had
been propelling himself toward
the open door. At the
instant of the revelation, he
had been part way through it.
And at that moment, Sager
acted.</p>

<p>He slammed all his weight
violently against his side of
the door, knocking Houston
off balance as the door swung
and struck him. He went
down, and Sager was on top
of him before he struck the
floor.</p>

<p>It was the weirdest battle
ever fought, but its true worth
could only have been detected
by another telepath. It was intense
and brutal.</p>

<p>The men fought both physically
and mentally. They
struggled for possession of
the stun gun, at the same
time hurling emotion-charged
shafts of mental energy at
each other's brains.</p>

<p>The struggle lasted less
than a minute. Somehow,
Sager managed to get one
hand on the gun, twisting it.
Houston, trying to keep it out
of Sager's hand, jerked it up
between them.</p>

<p>It coughed once, sending a
beam of supersonic energy
into the bodies of both men.</p>

<p>The effect was the same as
if they had both been crowned
with baseball bats.</p>

<hr />

<p>Little pinpoints of light
against a sea of darkness.</p>

<p><i>I'm cold</i>, Houston thought.
<i>And I'm sick.</i></p>

<p>He couldn't tell whether his
eyes were open or closed&mdash;and
he didn't much care.</p>

<p>He tried to move his arms
and legs, found he couldn't,
and gave it up.</p>

<p>He blinked.</p>

<p><i>My eyes must be open</i>, he
thought, <i>if I can blink</i>.</p>

<p>Well, then, if his eyes were
open, why couldn't he see anything?
All he could see were
the little pinpoints of light
against a background of utter
blackness.</p>

<p><i>Like stars</i>, he thought.</p>

<p><i>Stars? STARS!</i></p>

<p>With a sudden rush, total
awareness came back to him,
and he realized with awful
clarity where he was.</p>

<p>He was chained, spread-eagled,
on an asteroid in the
Penal Cluster, nearly a hundred
million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>It was easy to piece together
what had happened. He
dimly remembered that he
had started to wake up once
before. It was a vague, confused
recollection, but he
knew what had taken place.</p>

<p>The PD Police, coming in
response to his call, had found
all four men unconscious from
the effects of the stun beam.
Naturally, all of them had
been taken into custody; the
PD Police had to find out
which one of the men was the
Controller and which the controlled.
That could easily be
tested by waiting until they
began to wake up; the resulting
mental disturbances would
easily identify the telepath.</p>

<p>Houston could imagine the
consternation that must have
resulted when the PD men
found that all three suspects&mdash;<i>and</i>
their brother officer&mdash;were
Controllers.</p>

<p>And now here he was&mdash;tried,
convicted, and sentenced
while he was unconscious&mdash;doomed
to spend the
rest of his life chained to a
rock floating in space.</p>

<p>A sudden chill of terror
came over him. Why wasn't
he asleep? Why wasn't he under
hibernene?</p>

<p><i>It's their way of being
funny</i>, came a bitter thought.
<i>We're supposed to be under
hibernene, but we're left to
die, instead.</i></p>

<p>For a moment, Houston did
not realize that the thought
was not his own, so well did it
reflect his own bitterness. It
was bad enough to have to live
out one's life under the influence
of the hibernation drug,
but it was infinitely worse to
be conscious. Under hibernene,
he would have known
nothing; his sleeping mind in
his comatose body would never
have realized what had happened
to him. But this way, he
would remain fully awake
while his body used up the air
too fast and his stomach became
twisted with hunger
pangs which no amount of
intravenous feeding could
quell. Oh, he'd live, all right&mdash;for
a few months&mdash;but it
would be absolute hell while
he lasted. Insanity and catatonia
would come long before
death.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>That's a nasty thought; I
wish you hadn't brought it up.</i></p>

<p>That wasn't his own
thought! There was someone
else out here!</p>

<p><i>Hell, yes, my friend; we're
all out here.</i></p>

<p>"Where are you?" Houston
asked aloud, just to hear his
own voice. He knew the other
couldn't hear the words which
echoed so hollowly inside the
bubble of the spacesuit helmet,
but the thought behind them
would carry.</p>

<p>"You mean with relation to
yourself?" came the answer.
"I don't know. I can see several
rocks around me, but I
can't tell which one you're
on."</p>

<p>Houston could tell now that
the other person was talking
aloud, too. So great was the
illusion carried to his own
brain that it almost seemed as
though he could hear the voice
with his ears.</p>

<p>"Then there are others
around us?" Houston asked.</p>

<p>"Sure. There were three of
us: a Hawaiian named Jerry
Matsukuo; a girl from Bombay,
Sonali Siddhartha; and
myself, Juan Pedro de Cadiz.
Jerry and Sonali are taking a
little nap. You're the first of
your group to wake up."</p>

<p>"My group?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my friend.
There are five of you; the
other four must still be unconscious."</p>

<p>Four? That would be Lasser,
Sager, Pederson, and&mdash;<i>and
Dorrine!</i></p>

<p>Juan Pedro de Cadiz picked
up the whole thought-process
easily.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;I'm sorry," he
said. "But the other three&mdash;of
us all, I think, they deserve
this."</p>

<p>"Juan!" came another
thought-voice. "Have our newcomers
awakened?"</p>

<p>"Just one of them, my
sweet," replied the Spaniard.
"Sonali, may I present Mr.
David Houston. Mr. Houston,
the lovely Sonali Siddhartha."</p>

<p>"Juano has a habit of
jumping to conclusions, David,"
said the girl. "He's
never even seen me, and I'm
sure that after three weeks of
being locked in this prison
whatever beauty I may have
had has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Your thoughts are beautiful,
Sonali," said Juan Pedro,
"and with us, that is all that
counts."</p>

<p>"It is written," said a third
voice, "that he who disturbs
the slumber of his betters will
wake somebody up. You people
are giving me dreams,
with your ceaseless mental
chatter."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the Spaniard said.
"Mr. Matsukuo, may I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I heard, Romeo, I heard,"
said the Hawaiian. "An ex-cop,
eh? I wonder if I like
you? I'll take a few thousand
years to think it over; in the
meantime, you may treat me
as a friend."</p>

<p>"I'll try to live down my
reputation," said Houston.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was an odd feeling.
Physically, he was alone.
Around him, he could see
nothing but the blackness of
space and the glitter of the
stars. He knew that the sun
must be shining on the back
of his own personal asteroid,
but he couldn't see it. As far
as his body was concerned,
there was nothing else in the
universe but a chunk of pitted
rock and a set of chains.</p>

<p>But mentally, he felt snug
and warm, safe in the security
of good friends. He felt&mdash;</p>

<p>"David! David! Help me!
Oh, David, David, David!"</p>

<p>It was Dorrine, coming up
from her slumber. Like a
crashing blare of static across
the neural band, her wakening
mind burst into sudden
telepathic activity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Gently, Houston sent out
his thoughts, soothing her
mind as he had soothed Harris's
mind weeks before. And
he noticed, as he did it, that
the other three were with him,
helping. By the time Dorrine
was fully awake, she was no
longer frightened or panicky.</p>

<p>"You're wonderful people,"
she thought simply, after several
minutes.</p>

<p>"To one so beautiful, how
else could we be?" asked Juan
Pedro.</p>

<p>"Ignore him, Dorrine," said
Sonali, "he tells me the same
thing."</p>

<p>"But not in the same way,
<i>amiga</i>!" the Spaniard protested.
"Not in the same way.
The beauty of your mind,
Sonali, is like the beauty of a
mountain lake, cool and serene;
the beauty of Dorrine
is like the beauty of the sun&mdash;warm,
fiery, and brilliant."</p>

<p>"By my beard!" snorted
Matsukuo. "Such blather!"</p>

<p>"I'll be willing to wager my
beautiful <i>hacienda</i> in the
lovely countryside of Aragon
against your miserable palm-leaf
<i>nipi</i> shack on Oahu that
you have no beard," said Juan
Pedro.</p>

<p>"Hah!" said Matsukuo;
"that's all I need now&mdash;Castles
in Spain."</p>

<p>It was suddenly dizzying
for Houston. Here were five
people, doomed to slow, painful
death, talking as though
there were nothing to worry
about. Within minutes, each
had learned to know the others
almost perfectly.</p>

<p>It was more than just the
words each used. Talking
aloud helped focus the
thoughts more, but at the
same time, thousands of little,
personal, fringe ideas were
present with the main idea
transmitted in words. Houston
had talked telepathically to
Dorrine hundreds of times,
but never before had so much
fine detail come through.</p>

<p>Why? Was there something
different about space that
made mental communication
so much more complete?</p>

<p>"No, not that, I think," said
Matsukuo. "I believe it is because
we have lost our fear&mdash;not
of death; we still fear
death&mdash;but of betrayal."</p>

<p>That was it. They knew
they were going to die, and
soon. They had already been
sentenced; nothing further
could frighten them. Always
before, on Earth, they had
kept their thoughts to themselves,
fearing to broadcast
too much, lest the Normals
find them out. The little, personal
things that made a human
being a living personality
were kept hidden behind
heavy mental walls. The suppression
worked subconsciously,
even when they actually
wanted to communicate with
another Controller.</p>

<p>But out here, there was
nothing to fear on that score.
Why should they, who were
already facing death, be
afraid of anything now?</p>

<p>So they opened up&mdash;wide.
And they knew each other as
no group of human beings had
ever known each other. Every
human being has little faults
and foibles that he may be
ashamed of, that he wants to
keep hidden from others. But
such things no longer mattered
out here, where they had
nothing but imminent death
and the emptiness of space&mdash;and
each other.</p>

<p>Physically, they were miserable.
To be chained in one
position, with very little room
to move around, for three
weeks, as Sonali had been, was
torture. Sonali had been there
longer than the others&mdash;for
three days, there had been no
one but herself out there in
the loneliness of space.</p>

<p>But now, even physical discomfort
meant little; it was
easy to forget the body when
the mind was free.</p>

<p>"What of the others?" Dorrine
asked. "Where are the
ones who were sentenced before
us?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston thought of Robert
Harris. What had happened
to the young Englishman?</p>

<p>"Space is big," said Juan
Pedro. "Perhaps they are too
far away for our thoughts to
reach them&mdash;or perhaps they
are already dead."</p>

<p>"Let's not talk of death."
Sonali Siddhartha's thought
was soft. "We have so many
things to do."</p>

<p>"We will have a language
session," said Juan Pedro.
"<i>Si?</i>"</p>

<p>Matsukuo chuckled. "Good!
Houston, until you've tried to
learn Spanish, Hindustani,
Arabic, Japanese, and French
all at once, you don't know
what a language session is.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Hawaiian's thought
was suddenly broken off by a
shrieking burst of mental
static.</p>

<p>The effect was similar to
someone dropping a handful
of broken glass into an electric
meat grinder right in the
middle of a Bach cantata.</p>

<p>It was Sager, coming out of
his coma.</p>

<p>Almost automatically, the
five contacted his mind to relax
him as he awoke. They
touched his mind&mdash;and were
repelled!</p>

<p><i>Stay out of my mind!</i></p>

<p>With almost savage fury,
the still half-conscious Sager
hurled thoughts of hatred and
fear at the five minds who had
tried to help him. They recoiled
from the burst of insane
emotion.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone," Houston
thought sharply. "He's a tough
fighter."</p>

<hr />

<p>At first, Sager was terrified
when he learned what had
happened to him. Then the
terror was mixed with a boiling,
seething hatred. A hatred
of the Normals who had done
this to him, and an even more
terrible hatred for Houston,
the "traitor."</p>

<p>The very emptiness of space
itself seemed to vibrate with
the surging violence of his
hatred.</p>

<p>"I know," Houston told him,
"you'd kill me if you could.
But you can't, so forget it."</p>

<p>Not even the power of that
hatred could touch Houston,
protected as he was by the
combined strength of the
other four sane telepaths. He
was comparatively safe.</p>

<p>Sager snarled like a trapped
animal. "You're all insane!
Look at you! The four
of you, siding with a man who
has betrayed us to the Normals!
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>What Sager thought of
Houston couldn't be put into
words, and if it could no sane
person would want to repeat
the mad foulness in those
words.</p>

<p>"This is unbearable!" Sonali
thought softly.</p>

<p>"That's not a mind," said
Dorrine, "it's a sewer."</p>

<p>"I suggest," said Matsukuo,
"that we do a little probing.
Let's find out what makes this
thing tick."</p>

<p>"Stay out of my mind!"
Sager screamed. "You have no
right!"</p>

<p>"You seemed to think you
had the right to probe into the
helpless minds of Normals,"
said Juan Pedro coldly. "We
should show you how it feels."</p>

<p>"But they're just animals!"
Sager retorted. "I am a Controller!"</p>

<p>"You're a madman," said
Matsukuo. "And we must find
out what makes you mad."</p>

<p>Synchronizing perfectly,
five minds began to probe at
the walls that Sager had built
up around his personality.
And as they probed, Sager retreated
behind ever thicker
walls, howling in hatred and
anguish.</p>

<p>On and on went the five,
needling, pressing at every
weak spot, trying to break him
down. Outnumbered and overpowered,
it seemed as though
Sager had no chance.</p>

<p>But his insanity was stronger
than they suspected. The
barriers he built were harder,
more opaque, and more impenetrable
than any they had
ever seen. The five pushed on,
anyway, but their advance
slowed tremendously.</p>

<p>Then, mentally, there was a
sudden silence.</p>

<p><i>Sager?</i> they thought.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"That's finished it," said
Houston. "He's retreated so
far behind those mental barriers
that he's cut himself off
completely."</p>

<p>"He's not dead, is he?" Dorrine
asked.</p>

<p>"Dead?" said Juan Pedro.
"Not in the sense you mean.
But I think he is catatonic
now; he has lost all touch with
the outside. He is as though
he were still drugged; he is
physically helpless, and mentally
blanked out."</p>

<p>"There's one difference,"
Matsukuo said analytically.
"And that is that, although he
has cut himself off from us
and from the rest of the universe,
he is still conscious in
some little, walled-in compartment
of his mind. He has no
one there but himself&mdash;and
that, I think, is damned poor
company."</p>

<hr />

<p>They waited then. When
Pederson awoke, they were
ready for him. His hatred took
a slightly different form from
Sager's, but the effect was the
same.</p>

<p>And so were the results
when the five bore down on
him.</p>

<p>Again they waited. Lasser
was next.</p>

<p>At first, it looked as though
Lasser would go the way of
Sager and Pederson, ending
up as a hopelessly insane catatonic.
Like his cohorts before
him, Lasser retreated under
the full pressure of the
thought-probes of the five,
building stronger and stronger
walls.</p>

<p>But, quite suddenly, all his
defenses crumbled. The mental
barriers went down, shattered
and dissolving. Lasser's
whole mind lay bare. Instead
of fighting and hating, Lasser
was begging, pleading for
help.</p>

<p>Lasser was not basically insane.
His mind was twisted
and warped, but beneath the
outer shell was a personality
that had enough internal
strength to be able to admit
that it was wrong and ask for
help instead of retreating into
oblivion.</p>

<p>"This one&mdash;I think we can
do something with," Matsukuo's
thought whispered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eight bodies, uncomfortable
and pain-wracked, floated in
space, chained to tiny asteroids
that drifted slowly in
their orbits under the constant
pull of the sun. Two of them
contained minds that were
locked irrevocably within
prisons of their own building,
sealed off forever from external
stimuli, but their suffering
was the greater for all
that.</p>

<p>The other six, chained
though their limbs might be,
had minds that were free&mdash;free,
even, of any but the most
necessary of internal limitations.</p>

<p>Eight bodies, chained to
eight lumps of pitted rock,
spun endlessly in endless
space.</p>

<p>And then the ship came.</p>

<p>The flare of its atomic
rocket could be seen for over
an hour before it reached the
Penal Cluster. The six eyed it
speculatively. Although only
two of them were facing the
proper direction to see it with
their physical eyes, the impressions
of those two were
easily transmitted to the other
four.</p>

<p>"Another load of captives,"
whispered Juan Pedro de
Cadiz. "How many this time,
I wonder?"</p>

<p>"How long have we been
here?" asked Houston, not expecting
any answer.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" It was Lasser.
"What we need out here
is a clock to tell us when we'll
die."</p>

<p>"Our oxygen tanks are our
clocks," said Sonali. "And
they'll notify us when the time
comes."</p>

<p>"I do believe you morbid-minded
people are developing
a sense of humor," said Matsukuo,
"but I'm not sure I care
for the style too much."</p>

<p>The flare of the rocket grew
brighter as the decelerating
ship approached the small
cluster of rocks. At last the
ship itself took form, shining
in the eternal blaze of the sun.
When the whiteness of the
rocket blaze died suddenly,
the ship was only a few dozen
yards from Houston's own asteroid.</p>

<p>And then a mental voice
came into the minds of the six
prisoners.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Controllers?"</p>

<p>Only Houston recognized
that thought-pattern, but his
recognition was transmitted
instantly to the others.</p>

<p>"<i>Reinhardt!</i>"</p>

<p>Hermann Reinhardt, Division
Chief of the Psychodeviant
Police, the one man most
hated and feared by Controllers,
was himself a telepath!</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Reinhardt.
"Someone had to take
control of the situation. I was
the only one who was in a position
to do it."</p>

<p>His thoughts were neither
hard nor cold; it was almost
as if he were one of them&mdash;except
for one thing. Only the
words of his thoughts came
through; there were none of
the fringe thoughts that the
six were used to in each other.</p>

<p>"That's true," thought Reinhardt.
"You see, we have been
at this a good deal longer
than you." Then he directed
his thoughts at members of
the crew of the spaceship, but
they could still be heard by
the six prisoners. "All right,
men, get those people off those
rocks. We have to make room
for another batch."</p>

<p>The airlock in the side of
the ship opened, and a dozen
spacesuited men leaped out.
The propulsion units in their
hands guided them toward the
prison asteroids.</p>

<p>"Give them all anaesthetic
except Sager and Pederson,"
Reinhardt ordered. "They
won't need it." Then, with a
note of apology, "I'm sorry
we'll have to anaesthetize you,
but you've been in one position
so long that moving you
will be rather painful. We
have to get you to a hospital
quickly."</p>

<p>The minds of the six prisoners
were frantically pounding
questions at the PD chief,
but he gave them no answer.
"No; wait until you're better."</p>

<p>The spacesuited rescuers
went to the "back" of each asteroid
and injected sleep-gas
into the oxygen line that ran
from the tank to the spacesuit
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Houston could smell the
sweetish, pungent odor in his
helmet. Just before he blacked
out, he hurled one last accusing
thought at Reinhardt.</p>

<p>"<i>You're</i> the one who's been
framing Controllers!"</p>

<p>"Naturally, Houston," came
the answer. "How else could I
get you out here?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston woke up in a hospital
bed. He was weak and
hungry, but he felt no pain.
As he came up from unconsciousness,
he felt a fully
awake mind guiding him out
of the darkness.</p>

<p>It was Reinhardt.</p>

<p>"You're a tough man, Houston,"
he said mentally. "The
others won't wake up for a
while yet."</p>

<p>He was sitting on a chair
next to the bed, holding a
smouldering cigarette in one
hand. He looked strange,
somehow, and it took Houston
a moment to realize that there
was a smile on that broad,
normally expressionless face.</p>

<p>Houston focussed his eyes
on the man's face. "I want an
explanation, Reinhardt," he
said aloud. "And it better be
a damned good one."</p>

<p>"I give you free access to
my mind," Reinhardt said.
"See for yourself if my method
wasn't the best one."</p>

<hr />

<p>Houston probed. The explanation,
if not the best, was
better than any Houston
could have thought of.</p>

<p>When the hatred of the
normal-minded people of
Earth had been turned
against the Controllers because
of the actions of a few
megalomaniacs, it had become
obvious that legal steps had to
be taken to prevent mob violence.</p>

<p>It had been Reinhardt himself
who had suggested the
Penal method to the UN government.
At first, he had
simply thought of it as a
method to keep the Controllers
alive until he could think
of something better. But when
he had discovered, by accident,
what a small group of
Controllers, alone in space,
could do, he had set up the
present machinery.</p>

<p>As soon as a Controller was
spotted, a careful frame-up
was arranged. Then, when
several had been found, they
were arrested in quick succession
and sent to the asteroids.</p>

<p>Always and invariably, they
had done what Houston's
group had done&mdash;the sane or
potentially sane ones had improved
themselves tremendously,
while the megalomaniacs
had lapsed into catatonia.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't it be done on
Earth?" Houston asked.</p>

<p>"We tried it," Reinhardt
said. "It didn't work. Safe, on
Earth, surrounded by Normals,
a Controller still feels
the hatred around him. He
can't open his mind completely.
Only the certain knowledge
of impending death, and
a complete freedom from the
hatred of Normals can free
the mind.</p>

<p>"And that's why you
couldn't be told beforehand;
if you knew you were going
to be rescued, you wouldn't
open up."</p>

<p>Houston nodded. It made
sense. "Where are we now?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Antarctica," said Reinhardt.
"We've built an outpost
here&mdash;almost self-sufficient.
When you're in better shape
physically, I'll show you
around."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that everyone
who's been arrested is
here, in Antarctica?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Reinhardt laughed. "No,
not by a long shot. Most of us
are back out in civilization,
searching for new, undiscovered
Controllers, so that we
can frame them. And, of
course, some of us&mdash;the insane
ones&mdash;have died. They
will themselves to die when
the going gets too tough."</p>

<p>"Searching for recruits?
Then the Group that Dorrine
was working for was&mdash;"</p>

<p>Reinhardt shook his head.
"No. They were going about
it the wrong way, just as you
thought. We picked up the
whole lot of them last week;
they're occupying the asteroids
now."</p>

<p>"What do you do with the
insane catatonics?"</p>

<p>"Put them under hibernene
and keep them alive. We hope,
someday, to figure out a
method of restoring their sanity.
Until then, let them
sleep."</p>

<p>Houston narrowed his eyes.
"How long have you known I
was a Controller, Reinhardt?"</p>

<p>The Prussian smiled. "Ever
since you first tried to probe
me. Fortunately, my training
enabled me to put up a shield
that you couldn't penetrate; I
seemed like a Normal to you.</p>

<p>"I kept you on because I
knew you'd be useful in
cracking Lasser and his gang
when the time came. No one
else could have done what you
did that night."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Houston said sincerely.
"What's going to happen
now? After I get well, I
mean."</p>

<p>"You'll do what the others
have done. A little plastic
surgery to change your face a
trifle, a little record-juggling
to give you a new identity,
and you'll be ready to go back
to work for the PD Police.</p>

<p>"If anyone recognizes you,
it's easy to take over their
minds just long enough to
make them forget. We allow
that much Controlling."</p>

<p>"And then what?" Houston
wanted to know. "What happens
in the long run?"</p>

<p>"In a way," said Reinhardt,
"your friend Sager was right.
The Controllers will eventually
become the rulers of
Earth. But not by force or
trickery. We must just bide
our time. More and more of us
are being born all the time;
the Normals are becoming
fewer and fewer. Within a
century, we will outnumber
them&mdash;we will be the Normals,
not they.</p>

<p>"But they'll never know
what's going on. The last Normal
will die without ever
knowing that he is in a world
of telepaths.</p>

<p>"By the time that comes
about, we'll no longer need the
Penal Cluster, since Controllers
will be born into a world
where there is no fear of non-telepaths."</p>

<p>"I wonder," Houston mused,
"I wonder how this ability
came about. Why is the human
race acquiring telepathy
so suddenly?"</p>

<p>Reinhardt shrugged. "I can
give you many explanations&mdash;atomic
radiation, cosmic rays,
natural evolution. But none of
them really explains it. They
just make it easier to live
with.</p>

<p>"I think something similar
must have happened a few
hundred thousand years ago,
when Cro-Magnon man, our
own ancestors, first developed
true intelligence instead of the
pseudo-intelligence, the highly
developed instincts, of the
Neanderthals and other para-men.</p>

<p>"Within a relatively short
time, the para-men had died
out, leaving the Cro-Magnon,
with his true intelligence, to
rule Earth."</p>

<p>Reinhardt stood up. "Why
is it happening? We don't
know. Maybe we never will
know, any more than we know
why Man developed intelligence."
He shrugged. "Perhaps
the only explanation
we'll ever have is to call it the
Will of God and let it go at
that."</p>

<p>"Maybe that's the best explanation,
after all," Houston
said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Who knows?"
Reinhardt crushed his cigarette
out in a tray. "I'll go
now, and let you get some rest.
And don't worry; I'll have
you notified as soon as Dorrine
starts to come out of it."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;Chief," Houston
said as Reinhardt left the
room.</p>

<p>David Houston lay back in
his bed and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>For the first time in his
life, he felt completely at
peace&mdash;with himself, and
with the Universe.</p>
